# Team Notes — Development Process

## Git Workflow
Each member created their own branch:

- `feat/aditya-data-io`
- `feat/shiv-stats-kpi`
- `feat/poorvi-sort-search`
- `feat/taqi-cli`

They committed their modules in small, clean commits and created Pull Requests.  
The repo owner (Taqi) reviewed and merged.

## Work Division
- Backend modules were built separately (dynarray, io, stats, kpi, sort_search).
- CLI was kept separate until backend was complete.
- Final integration was done by Taqi.
