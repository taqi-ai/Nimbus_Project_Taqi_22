Team Notes — Development Process
Git Workflow

Each team member worked on an isolated feature branch to maintain clean version control:

feat/aditya-data-io

feat/shiv-stats-kpi

feat/poorvi-sort-search

feat/taqi-cli

All modules were committed in small, well-structured updates. Pull Requests were raised for every major change, reviewed, and merged by the repository maintainer (Taqi). This ensured consistent code quality and avoided merge conflicts.

Work Division

The project was divided into independent backend components:

Dynamic Array Module

File I/O Module

Statistics Module

KPI Module

Sorting & Searching Module

Each member completed their assigned module individually.
The CLI module was intentionally developed later to ensure it integrated smoothly with all backend features.

The final integration, debugging, and executable build were completed by Taqi, combining all modules into a single functional application.
